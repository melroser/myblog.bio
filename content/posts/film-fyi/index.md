This is unfinished but check out my new webiste.

Just Click the image above!


My goal was to figure out a was to make large image gallery really performant as a web application. Cheap to host and automated so as I rate things 3 stars or higher in Lightroom they will appear. [^location]  my first versions of this use a random assorment of images which i like but found a common complain among people checking it out was that it was diffifult to find any particular image they found before.

[^location]: here is the footnote i guess?  dont worry about the rest its just filler text. The plate in the Pl. Enl., quoted above, has been considered by all previous writers to have reference to this bird, and while I coincide in this opinion, I think that some mistake must have arisen as to the locality, and that it never visits New Guinea nor even the northern coast of Australia, where its place is supplied by the Dacelo cervina and D. Leachii.

I believe that this bird seldom, if ever, drinks; consequently the most arid plains are as suitable to its habits as the shrouded river sides and the flat brushes near the coast.
